<h1>Weekly Assignment 2</h1>
<p>What happened this week with WallStreetBets and GameStop was really interesting. There were many people on Reddit and online that were trying to stop the hedge fund investors from selling shorts. I am not sure why exactly, but it seems like they wanted to make some money, help out gamestop, or just stop the wall street guys from doing a financially risky task that could also pose some threat. Regardless of why, a lot of people of Reddit did in fact make some money, and become famous while doing so.

One guy even made so much money he bought some nintendo switches to send to a hospital. Regardless of how they spent their money, it was nice seeing the little guys make some money for a chance, instead of your typical wall street guy. It was cool seeing that when people stand up together and for a common cause, there are bound to be good results. However, the big guys at Robinhood tried to stop the redditors from doing this, or rather it was later revealed that they did not have the capital to let them keep exploiting the shorters. The CEO also got in trouble for this however.

Some people argue that what the redditors and other internet folk did was wrong, or at the very least greedy. I disagree however, since shorting is known to be a financially risky thing that is arguably wrong itself. Just look at the housing crisis that was the subject of the hit movie "The Big Short." I am pretty sure in that movie the bad guys were the guys on wall street, not the little guys that made some money taking advantage of the situation (ok some of them were bad too). In this case though, the little guys were trying to help out Gamestop and prevent Wallstreet from destroying their shares.

Anyways, anyone that takes advantage of people losing their money are bad people, whether they work on wall street or not. This event just highlights how dumb people are on wall street, but mainly how there needs to be more regulations so dumb people cant do these dumb things so often (or ever). Maybe I am just salty that I did not invest in Gamestop when I could have, but investing is pretty much gambling so maybe not. It is interesting how gambling is considered illegal everywhere outside of casinos and wall street, but what do I know.

At the end of the day, we all learned a little bit about the stock market, and a lot about the on-going greed and stupidity on wall street. At least this time though, some average-joes made some money. However, this practice is sure to not stop in the future as long as it remains legal. These risky financial sellings are bad not just common people, but it also make investors all look bad, worsening the trust in the financial sector. Will these people learn? Probably not.
