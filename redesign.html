<h1>Redesign Page</h1>
<p>
The <a href="homepage.html">homepage</a> was changed to add a thumbnail picture of myself, as well as a description of the intended purpose of the website. I added a block to seperate this information from the rest of the website. I also added a nav bar with bootstrap that links to the other pages.
For the <a href="aboutme.html">About Me</a> page I chose to keep it consistent througout the whole website by keeping the background picture the same as well as the nav bar. For things I changed, there was the font color change, background change, and spacing change to move everything away from the left side of the screen. 
The <a href="Portfolio.html">Portfolio</a> page has the same changes listed in the about me page. I had to think about the form and layout of the pages to make sure it was easy to click the buttons, so I experimented with right side linking nav buttons but they were too far away from my links to my other sites like Github and linkedIn.
The <a href="contact.html">Contact Me</a> page is the same as the other new pages but has a conact form a visitor can fill out if they want to get in contact with me. This was copied from a ww3 tutorial and then changed to fit the needs of my website's design by getting rid of things I already included like my email and purpose of giving a contact page.
