I really like this <a href="https://www.icelandicexplorer.com/">site</a>. The background pcitures that fade in, the middle picture, the clean look, and overall layout are very nice.

I also liked this <a href="https://evoxlab.com/#home">site</a>. It was a really nice design with a really inspiring pictures that I tried to emulate in my site. It has a clear goal but also has a lot of extra things around the site which I like.

I liked this site <a href="https://dataf.org/en/">site</a>. It has a good color scheme that is highlighted by having a dark background. I did a similar thing with my website, by using color to highlight the important areas that I wanted to draw attention to.
