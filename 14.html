To tell people about the tv show The Simpsons I might use Jupiter notebooks to show data scientists the reasons why the newer Simpson’s episodes are worse. This is because data scientists would be able to understand easily how Jupiter notebooks works, as it is all about running cells and changing code on the fly. They would find this very helpful and familiar, as being able to change code and compile it to see they changes without going to the terminal all the time is an attribute of other data analyzing tools like R studio.

To show a board of directors for a studio like Fox why their show sucks now, I might use a program like Reveal JS as it makes a very good presenting tool for showing data analysis. Board of Directors usually no not know or need to know the underlying code of data visualizations, thus they would be most persuades by the PowerPoint like tool of Reveal. Slideware is very important and used a lot during business meetings, thus Reveal would be right at home for a platform that allows for a combination of a familiar feel, but with the data visualization capabilities of other popular viz tools.

To inform internet dwellers the inferiority of the newer Simpson’s episodes, I would put data visualizations on a website using bootstrap to help catch the eyes of any onlookers. This is a perfect tool at the website allows for a story to be told with numerous pages and a complete feel to it, that would be harder to accomplish on Reveal or Jupiter Notebooks. Also, websites allow for a way for users to find it on their own if it gets popular enough through an engine like Google. Internet dwellers would be most comfortable using a website as they love the internet and spend most of their time there.
